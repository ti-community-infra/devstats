However, I'm not sure about this API and I haven't tested it much.  So I'm opening this \"issue\" to discuss if you're interested in the change and/or have opinions about the API design.\n\nAn example use: This could be used to implement a \"find within current paragraph\" functionality if someone wanted to only search a paragraph rather than a whole file for some reason.\n\n(Was this explanation clear, or should I try again?)\n"
